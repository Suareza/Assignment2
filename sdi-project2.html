    This week got a bit complicated with the story but over all stuck to the original theme from the first assignment.
</p>
<p>
    Starting to develop the story and adding minor details to it. I begin the story at the location of last week. Last week I left of where I entered the groceries store to ask information about a poster by the window. The poster read the following:
     "Sony is having a FIFA 12 Tournament and first prize is $140,000 dollars for the first place winner. Sign up now exclusively for the Playstation 3 game console."
      I began to search my pockets for money (cause the entry fee costs $10) and found out that I only had some jolly rancher wrappers and a grocery list and a 20 dollar bill.
</p>
<p>
    The story continues (for this week) when begin to read the carefully the instructions of the Tournament. There are three options: Option A, Option B, and Option C to advance to the finals. So this week I decided to write about the different options I had
     and about how it would differ from any option that I picked. Once the option was choosen then I was able to play the matchups and see if I qualified or not.
